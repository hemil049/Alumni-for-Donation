# Targeting Alumni for Donation

## Introduction 

### University Advancement is a department in many universities that plans many programs and activities to help the University establish and maintain strong relationships with alumni, donors and potential donors. These relationships are established and maintained through two primary arms of University Advancement: Development (Fundraising) and Alumni Relations.


## Problem

### The University had always had a strong presence in the Quebec marketplace, but with the impending launch of a major fundraising campaign, University Advancement had to start increasing donation sources.

### University Advancement had been working with a matrix approach that was both faculty and region driven. Quebec had always been Universities’ primary target market but Ontario seemed like the natural second choice– it was a neighboring province, had a huge alumni pool and was also the Canadian financial hub. 

### Alexandra also knew there had been a huge oil boom in Western Canada in the past. There were additional questions about what Faculties should be going out there, whether or not they would even be able to reach those alumni after all these years, how many of them would be likely to make a gift. 

### All of these questions were put against the backdrop of maintaining a strong presence in Quebec, so she knew she could only target a few key regions. At the same time, she wondered whether the allocation of staff across the faculties made sense. She wanted to know which alumni were the most likely to make a donation and at which level.
